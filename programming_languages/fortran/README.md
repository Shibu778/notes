This folder contains fortran 90 programs to learn the basics of fortran programming language. 

For reference see the book Computational Quantum Mechanics by Joshua Izaac and Jingbo Wang.

To compile the program using gfortran compiler, use the following command in shell.

In windows
```shell
gfortran program_name.f90 -o executable_name.exe
```

In Linux
```shell
gfortran program_name.f90 -o executable_name.out
